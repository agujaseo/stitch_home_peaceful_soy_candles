description: Activate when migrating a contact-form schema between form plugins — moving Contact Form 7 forms to WPForms, WPForms to Gravity Forms, Gravity Forms to Fluent Forms, Fluent Forms to Formidable Forms, Ninja Forms to anything (or vice-versa), and so on. Walks the agent through the seven-phase workflow (audit → plan → execute → verify) using form-model-schema as the canonical intermediate format. Schemas only — submitted entries / Flamingo rows / WPForms entry table / Gravity entries / Fluent submissions / Formidable entries / Ninja Forms submissions are explicitly out of scope. Trigger phrases.

This skill turns the canonical vocabulary into a guided, confirmable migration — it does not claim one-click universal import/export.

# Form Model Migration

A workflow playbook for moving contact-form schemas between up to six form plugins (Contact Form 7, WPForms, Gravity Forms, Fluent Forms, Formidable Forms, Ninja Forms). Uses `form-model-schema` as the canonical intermediate format and treats migration as a seven-phase, user-confirmed pipeline — never an autonomous one-shot. The plugins listed represent the full intended coverage; whether a side is actually available in your install is decided at runtime by Phase 1 (`<plugin>-check-setup`) — branch on its result, never assume a reader is registered.

**Ninja Forms is a first-class, symmetric citizen** like the other five plugins. Novamira Pro drives it entirely through its own `novamira/ninja-forms-*` abilities (model layer — no dependency on Ninja's native `ninjaforms/*` abilities) for read AND write: `ninja-forms-check-setup` (Phase 1), `ninja-forms-list-forms` / `ninja-forms-get-form` / `ninja-forms-get-form-canonical` (Phase 2), and `ninja-forms-create-form` + `add-field` + `create-notification` + `edit-form` (Phase 5 when Ninja is the target). See the `ninja-forms-integration` skill for the full surface.

## Scope

**Covered:**
- Forms (one form per migration; loop the pipeline for batch migrations).
- Fields, with type translation via the `form-model-schema` 17-type vocabulary.
- Mail configuration: subject, sender, recipient, body, additional headers, attachments, HTML flag, exclude-blank flag.
- Additional notifications (autoresponder, secondary admin, BCC) when the source supports them.
- Validation messages (`messages{}`) — string-keyed, preserved as-is on round-trip.
- Conditional logic (`conditional_rules[]`) when the source exposes structured rules.
- Field-level validation rules (min, max, length, regex, mime accepts, file size).

**Not covered (out of scope by design):**
- Submitted entries (Flamingo `flamingo_inbound` / `flamingo_outbound` for CF7, WPForms `wpforms_entries` table, Gravity `gform_entry` table, Fluent `fluentform_submissions` table, Formidable `frm_items` table). Submission migration is a separate problem with plugin-specific storage layouts. Decline politely and direct the user to per-plugin export tools (CSV / XML) if they insist.
- Lossless conversion of:
  - Anti-spam configuration — Akismet, reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Turnstile, honeypots. Site-global per plugin, must be reconfigured on the target.
  - Anti-spam logic — CF7 `quiz`, WPForms anti-spam token, Gravity honeypot, Fluent reCAPTCHA. Lost on migration; warning severity `structural`.
  - Third-party integrations — Mailchimp, Salesforce, Stripe / PayPal payments, Zapier webhooks, CRM sync. Must be reconfigured on the target plugin manually.
  - Credentials / API tokens — Never migrated; recreate on target.
  - Multi-step / multi-page forms — canonical has no `page` field type; migrations produce a single-page equivalent with `severity: structural` warnings.
  - Form-level custom CSS / JS — out of scope, reapply manually.
- Builder bindings (Elementor form widget references, Bricks contact-form binding, Bricks query loops referencing form IDs). These break on the new plugin because the form ID changes — flag this as a follow-up task, do not attempt to translate in-place.

## Mandatory workflow

Before any write, the agent must walk these phases in order. Skipping a phase is not allowed.

### Phase 0 — Activate the prerequisite skills

In order, in the same turn:

1. `novamira/skill-get slug=form-model-schema` — load the canonical vocabulary.
2. `novamira/skill-get slug=<source-plugin>-integration` — e.g. `cf7-integration` if migrating from CF7.
3. `novamira/skill-get slug=<target-plugin>-integration` — e.g. `wpforms-integration` if migrating to WPForms.

Without all three, the agent does not have the knowledge to translate. `skill-get` returns `not_found` only when the slug literally does not exist in the bundled skill index (typo or the skill was renamed) — that's a fatal error, halt. The skill being registered does NOT imply the underlying plugin is installed on the site: that check happens in Phase 1 below via the per-plugin `check-setup` ability. Do not conflate the two.

### Phase 1 — Setup check, both ends

Call check-setup on both plugins. **Both must report active AND meet the minimum version.** Refuse to proceed otherwise — there is no point planning a migration toward an inactive target or one below the audited minimum.

| Source / target plugin | Setup ability | Min-version constant |
|---|---|---|
| Contact Form 7 | `novamira/cf7-check-setup` | `NOVAMIRA_PRO_CF7_MIN_VERSION` (5.8.0) |
| WPForms (Lite / Pro) | `novamira/wpforms-check-setup` | `NOVAMIRA_PRO_WPFORMS_MIN_VERSION` (1.8.0) |
| Gravity Forms | `novamira/gravityforms-check-setup` | `NOVAMIRA_PRO_GRAVITYFORMS_MIN_VERSION` (2.7) |
| Fluent Forms (Lite / Pro) | `novamira/fluentforms-check-setup` | `NOVAMIRA_PRO_FLUENTFORMS_MIN_VERSION` (6.0.0) |
| Formidable Forms (Lite / Pro) | `novamira/formidable-check-setup` | `NOVAMIRA_PRO_FORMIDABLE_MIN_VERSION` (6.0.0) |
| Ninja Forms | `novamira/ninja-forms-check-setup` | `NOVAMIRA_PRO_NINJAFORMS_MIN_VERSION` (3.13.0) — `storage_ready` flag must be `true` |

**Handle inactive-plugin null returns explicitly**: if a plugin is not active on the site, its `*-check-setup` ability is NOT registered in the WP Abilities API at all — `wp_get_ability('novamira/<plugin>-check-setup')` returns `null`, NOT a structured `{plugin_active: false}` response. Detect this with `if ( null === wp_get_ability(...) )` (or the equivalent in your wrapper) and treat as "plugin inactive — halt with a clear message instructing the user to activate the plugin first". Don't try to coerce a missing ability into a falsy structured response — it'll throw.

Record edition gates carefully. Each is a Phase-1 halt-condition if the target side doesn't satisfy it.

| Edition gate | Requirement | What to check in check-setup output |
|---|---|---|
| WPForms Pro field types | `rich-text`, `file-upload`, `multi-select`, `signature`, `rating`, `payment-*` | `wpforms-check-setup` reports `edition: pro`. Refuse to plan Pro types when target is Lite. |
| Gravity Forms license | All Gravity functionality | `gravityforms-check-setup` reports `license_active: true`. Gravity refuses to render forms on the front-end when the license has lapsed — refuse the migration if `false`. |
| Fluent Forms Pro field types | `repeater_field`, `signature`, `ratings`, `payment_*` | `fluentforms-check-setup` reports `edition: pro`. Refuse Pro types on Lite target. |
| Formidable Pro field types | `image`, `lookup`, `rich_text`, `signature`, `payment`, `summary`, `tags`, `address`, `name` (composite) | `formidable-check-setup` reports `edition: pro`. Refuse Pro types on Lite target. |
| CF7 | No edition gate (single-edition plugin) | `cf7-check-setup` always reports the same shape; `min_satisfied` is the only halt-condition. |

**Coexistence**: all five form plugins coexist at boot. No `Cannot redeclare ...` collisions in the supported version range. If two are active simultaneously (e.g. CF7 + WPForms during a transition), they each register their own admin menu and CPTs — no cross-conflict.

### Phase 2 — Read the source schema

Use the source integration's read abilities to produce a complete picture. The per-plugin read surface is **not symmetric** — each plugin has its own ability names and `include_fields` semantics. Use this table:

| Source plugin | List forms | Get form (full + canonical) | Tag/field vocabulary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contact Form 7 | `cf7-list-forms` | `cf7-get-form id=<id>` (raw shape) + `cf7-get-form-canonical id=<id>` (canonical shape with warnings) | `cf7-get-tags-schema` |
| WPForms | `wpforms-list-forms` | `wpforms-get-form id=<id>` + `wpforms-get-form-canonical id=<id>` | `wpforms-get-field-types` |
| Gravity Forms | `gravityforms-list-forms` | `gravityforms-get-form id=<id>` + `gravityforms-get-form-canonical id=<id>` | `gravityforms-get-field-types` |
| Fluent Forms | `fluentforms-list-forms` | `fluentforms-get-form id=<id>` + `fluentforms-get-form-canonical id=<id>` | `fluentforms-get-field-types` |
| Formidable Forms | `formidable-list-forms` | `formidable-get-form id=<id>` + `formidable-get-form-canonical id=<id>` | `formidable-get-field-types` |
| Ninja Forms | `ninja-forms-list-forms` | `ninja-forms-get-form form_id=<id>` (raw shape; `include=["fields","actions","settings"]`) + `ninja-forms-get-form-canonical form_id=<id>` (canonical shape with warnings) | `ninja-forms-get-field-types-schema` |

Prefer the `*-get-form-canonical` flavour when present — it returns the schema already mapped to the `form-model-schema` vocabulary plus the relevant `warnings[]`, saving the agent the manual translation step.

When the source plugin doesn't yet expose a canonical reader, fall back to the raw `*-get-form` and translate in Phase 3 using the per-plugin mapping section below.

### Phase 3 — Translate to canonical

Map the source form into a `form-model-schema` JSON document. Use the per-plugin "Mapping guidance" section below for field-type and structural translations.

While translating:

- For every concept that does NOT fit the canonical vocabulary, append an entry to `warnings[]` with:
  - `path` — JSON-pointer-ish reference (e.g. `fields[3].quiz`, `mail_config.additional_headers`).
  - `reason` — what is being dropped or transformed, in user-readable language.
  - `severity` — `structural` (semantics changed: anti-spam logic dropped, conditional logic flattened, multi-page collapsed to single-page) or `informational` (UI sugar dropped: CSS class names, label position hint, admin column).
- Never invent canonical types ad-hoc. If a source type has no canonical equivalent, model it with the closest match plus modifiers and warn about the gap.
- Normalize mail-tag syntax to `[field-name]` notation (the CF7 convention adopted as canonical). The target side translates back to its own syntax in Phase 5.

If the source's `*-get-form-canonical` ability already returned a canonical shape, this phase is a pass-through — preserve the warnings the ability emitted, do not re-translate.

### Phase 4 — Show the plan

Print to the user:

1. The canonical schema (compact summary if large — full body on request).
2. The migration plan: the target-plugin write that will be performed (ability name + payload shape) — usually a single `<target>-create-form` call, but some targets need follow-up `<target>-edit-form` for notifications that don't fit in `create`.
3. The full `warnings[]` list with severity.
4. Any structural warnings called out at the top of the message.
5. Name-collision detection: call `<target>-list-forms` and check whether a form with the same title or slug already exists. If yes, set `next_action_required: user_resolution_for_name_collision` and propose skip / rename / merge.

**Stop and request explicit user confirmation before any write.** If `warnings[]` contains entries with `severity: structural`, the confirmation must restate them ("Confermi anche queste perdite strutturali? <list>").

### Phase 5 — Execute (only after confirmation)

Call the target plugin's `create-form` ability with the translated payload. Sequence:

1. **Create the form** with `<target>-create-form`: title, slug, status, locale, fields, primary mail config, messages. This is the single load-bearing call.
2. **Add additional notifications** (when the source had `notifications[]` entries beyond the primary `mail_config`): one call to `<target>-edit-form id=<new id> notifications=[...]` (or, for plugins that store all notifications inline in the form payload, fold them into step 1).
3. **Apply conditional rules** (when both ends support `conditional_rules[]`): either inline in `create-form` or via a follow-up `<target>-edit-form`, plugin-dependent.
4. **Apply reserved-name renames** if the target rejected a field name as reserved (Gravity reserves `entry_id`, `form_id`, `date_created`, …; Fluent reserves `id`, `form_id`; WPForms reserves `wpforms_*`; Formidable reserves `frm_*`). The check happens at write-side — if a `*-create-form` fails with a reserved-name error, propose a prefixed alternative and re-run.

If any write fails, halt the pipeline. Do not auto-retry. Report which step failed, the error, and the partial state to the user (the new form may have been created but lack its notifications; the user must decide to delete-and-retry or patch in place).

**Per-plugin write abilities** — the canonical payload must be translated to each plugin's parameter convention. Read the ability description (`wp_get_ability(...)->get_input_schema()` or directly the file under `includes/abilities/<plugin>/`) before composing the payload. **Do not assume canonical key names match the target's keys.**

| Target plugin | Create form ability | Notifications shape |
|---|---|---|
| Contact Form 7 | `cf7-create-form title=... form=<form-tag string> mail={...} mail_2={...} messages={...}` | Exactly one `mail_2` (secondary). For >1 canonical notifications, only the FIRST is mapped to `mail_2`; remaining are dropped with `severity: structural`. |
| WPForms | `wpforms-create-form title=... fields=[...] notifications=[...]` | Array of notifications inline. |
| Gravity Forms | `gravityforms-create-form title=... fields=[...] notifications=[...]` | Array of notifications inline. |
| Fluent Forms | `fluentforms-create-form title=... fields=[...] notifications=[...]` | Array of notifications inline. |
| Formidable Forms | `formidable-create-form name=... fields=[...] actions=[...]` | Notifications are "Form Actions" of type `email`. |

**Canonical → CF7 form-tag string** (write side helper — keep this snippet as the reference implementation, agents may invoke it via `novamira/execute-php` when CF7 is the target):

```php
$tag_for = function (array $field): string {
    $type = $field['type'] ?? 'text';
    $name = $field['name'] ?? '';
    $required = !empty($field['required']) ? '*' : '';
    $opts = [];

    // Map canonical type → CF7 tag type
    $cf7_type = match ($type) {
        'text'     => 'text',
        'email'    => 'email',
        'tel'      => 'tel',
        'url'      => 'url',
        'number'   => 'number',
        'textarea' => 'textarea',
        'date'     => 'date',
        'select'   => 'select',
        'radio'    => 'radio',
        'checkbox' => 'checkbox',
        'file'     => 'file',
        'hidden'   => 'hidden',
        'submit'   => 'submit',
        'consent'  => 'acceptance',
        default    => 'text', // fallback — agent should have warned
    };

    if (!empty($field['placeholder'])) {
        $opts[] = 'placeholder "' . addslashes((string) $field['placeholder']) . '"';
    }
    if (!empty($field['validation']['min_length'])) {
        $opts[] = 'minlength:' . (int) $field['validation']['min_length'];
    }
    if (!empty($field['validation']['max_length'])) {
        $opts[] = 'maxlength:' . (int) $field['validation']['max_length'];
    }
    if (!empty($field['validation']['min'])) {
        $opts[] = 'min:' . $field['validation']['min'];
    }
    if (!empty($field['validation']['max'])) {
        $opts[] = 'max:' . $field['validation']['max'];
    }
    foreach (($field['choices'] ?? []) as $choice) {
        $opts[] = '"' . addslashes((string) ($choice['label'] ?? $choice['value'] ?? '')) . '"';
    }

    if ($cf7_type === 'submit') {
        // Submit carries its label as the only positional token.
        return '[submit "' . addslashes((string) ($field['label'] ?? 'Send')) . '"]';
    }

    $opts_str = $opts === [] ? '' : ' ' . implode(' ', $opts);
    return '[' . $cf7_type . $required . ' ' . $name . $opts_str . ']';
};

$form_tag_string = implode("\n", array_map($tag_for, $canonical['fields']));
```

The snippet is intentionally small — it's exactly the kind of "simple thing" that belongs as a documented `execute-php` template, not as a new ability. The complex part of CF7 (parsing the form-tag string back into structured canonical) IS a PHP ability (`cf7-get-form-canonical`) because the regex / modifier handling is non-trivial.

### Phase 6 — Verify

Re-read the target form with the same abilities used in Phase 2 (`<target>-get-form-canonical`), and produce a verification summary:

- Field count: canonical source vs canonical target.
- Per-field diff: type, required flag, validation block.
- Mail config diff: subject, sender, recipient, body presence.
- Notifications count match.
- Re-emitted `warnings[]` from the target read — these document what survived round-trip vs what was lost.

Surface the verification summary to the user before declaring success.

**Failure handler — re-read returns an error.** If `<target>-get-form-canonical` returns a `WP_Error` or the equivalent during verification (target plugin deactivated mid-pipeline, transient DB connectivity issue, form id corrupted, target check-setup now reporting inactive), do NOT mark the migration itself as failed — Phase 5 has already completed successfully and the target form exists. Instead:

1. Report to the user that the verification step could not run, citing the specific error from the re-read.
2. Emit `next_action_required: none` (the migration is complete; verification is the unverified deliverable).
3. Recommend the user re-run the workflow in `mode: verify` once the target plugin is reachable again — that path will produce the verification summary without re-creating anything.
4. Do not delete or roll back the target form on a verification failure. The Phase 6 failure is an observability gap, not a migration failure.

## Modes

The user can request a subset of the pipeline:

| Mode | Phases run | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `audit-only` | 0 → 3 | Canonical schema + warnings[]. No plan, no write. |
| `plan` | 0 → 4 | Canonical schema + migration plan + warnings[]. No write. |
| `execute` | 0 → 6 | Full pipeline; requires explicit confirmation between 4 and 5. |
| `verify` | 6 only (against an existing target form) | Verification summary comparing source canonical vs target canonical. Useful after a manual migration. |

If the user does not specify a mode, default to `plan` and ask whether to execute.

## Safety rules

These are non-negotiable. The agent must apply them even if the user asks to skip them.

1. **Never overwrite an existing target form** without the user explicitly typing the form title to confirm. If the target already has a form with the same title or slug as the one we are about to create:
   - **Stop the execute phase.**
   - Propose: (a) skip this form, (b) rename (offer a suffix like `_migrated`), or (c) merge — only when the structures are compatible.
2. **Never modify the source form** during migration. The migration is additive on the target side; the source is read-only.
3. **Never migrate stored submissions** as part of a schema migration. If the user asks for "everything", restate the scope ("Migro lo schema. Le submission richiedono un passo separato.") and require explicit re-confirmation if they insist.
4. **Always pause on `severity: structural` warnings** before Phase 5. Read them back to the user verbatim and require yes/no.
5. **Refuse delete operations on the source.** The migration never deletes the source form. Cleanup is a separate, explicit task.
6. **One pipeline per turn.** Don't chain multiple source-to-target migrations in one execute phase — each gets its own audit/plan/confirm cycle.
7. **Name collision on the target — detect at Phase 4, halt at Phase 5.** Call `<target>-list-forms` in Phase 4 and check whether a form with the same title or slug already exists. If yes, do NOT execute Phase 5 — instead set `next_action_required: user_resolution_for_name_collision` and present the user with three options: (a) skip this form, (b) rename with a suffix (`_migrated`, `_imported`), or (c) merge — only when the structures are compatible. Do not auto-resolve.
8. **Reserved field names — check at write-side, not at translate-side.** Each plugin has a different reserved set (Gravity `entry_id`, `form_id`, `date_created`, `created_by`, `is_starred`, `is_read`, `ip`, `source_url`, `post_id`, `currency`, `payment_status`, `payment_date`, `transaction_id`, `payment_amount`, `payment_method`, `is_fulfilled`, `transaction_type`, `user_agent`; Fluent Forms `id`, `form_id`, `serial_number`; WPForms `wpforms_*`; Formidable `frm_*`). The check belongs in Phase 5 (just before each `<target>-create-form` call), not in Phase 3 (translate). The source plugin's read abilities have no view of the target's reserved set, so do not try to populate a `warnings[]` entry from the translate side. If the create call rejects a name during execute, halt, propose a prefixed alternative (`contact_form_id`), and resume from there.
9. **Never migrate credentials.** API keys, integration tokens, payment processor secrets — never copied. The user reconfigures them on the target plugin from their source of truth.

## Mapping guidance — per plugin

Field-type translation goes through the `form-model-schema` 17-type vocabulary. Plugin-specific quirks the agent must know:

### Contact Form 7

CF7's form template is a **single string** of bracket-syntax form-tags, not a structured array. The `cf7-get-form-canonical` ability handles the parsing; from canonical the write-side rebuilds the string via the `execute-php` snippet shown in Phase 5.

**Form-tag → canonical:**

| CF7 form-tag | Canonical type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `text`, `text*` | `text` | `*` → `required: true`. `minlength:`, `maxlength:`, `placeholder` map to `validation` / `placeholder`. |
| `email`, `email*` | `email` | |
| `tel`, `tel*` | `tel` | |
| `url`, `url*` | `url` | |
| `number`, `number*` | `number` | `min:`, `max:`, `step:` → `validation`. |
| `date`, `date*` | `date` | `min:`, `max:` → `validation` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`). |
| `textarea`, `textarea*` | `textarea` | `cols:` / `rows:` go to `meta` (rendering hint, not canonical). |
| `select`, `select*` | `select` | `multiple` → `cardinality: multi`. `include_blank` → `meta`. Quoted tokens become `choices[]`. |
| `checkbox`, `checkbox*` | `checkbox` | `cardinality: multi` by default. `exclusive` → `meta` (single-pick mode). |
| `radio` | `radio` | `cardinality: single` always. |
| `file`, `file*` | `file` | `filetypes:` → `validation.accepts` (MIME-mapped). `limit:` → `validation.max_size_bytes`. |
| `acceptance` | `consent` | `optional` modifier → `warning: informational` (canonical `consent` is always required). |
| `quiz` | — | `warning: structural` — anti-spam logic has no canonical equivalent. |
| `submit` | `submit` | Quoted token → `label`. |
| `hidden` | `hidden` | `default:` → `default`. |
| `response` | — | Output area, no canonical equivalent — skipped in translation. |
| `recaptcha` | — | `warning: informational` — keys are site-global, not per-form. |

**Special mail-tags** (`[_serial_number]`, `[_remote_ip]`, `[_user_agent]`, `[_date]`, `[_time]`, `[_url]`, `[_post_title]`, `[_user_email]`) are preserved verbatim in `mail_config.body` and `mail_config.subject`. When the target plugin lacks equivalents, emit a `warning: informational` per occurrence.

**Mail config:** `mail` (primary) → `mail_config{}`. `mail_2` (secondary autoreply) → `notifications[{name:"autoreply", active, subject, sender, recipient, body, additional_headers, attachments, use_html, exclude_blank}]`.

**Messages:** preserved 1:1 (CF7 has ~20 message keys, not whitelisted — canonical `messages{}` accepts arbitrary keys).

**Quirks:**
- The form-tag string parser must handle the `*` required modifier, the optional quoted label, and `key:value` options. Regex anchored at `\[(?!\/)(<type>)(<\*?>)\s+(<name>)(.*?)\]` — full implementation in `cf7-get-form-canonical`.
- reCAPTCHA / Turnstile are site-global → not per-form, dropped with `warning: informational`.
- Submissions are NOT persisted by CF7 itself — Flamingo is a separate plugin and out of scope.
- `additional_settings` is a raw newline-separated string; treat as an opaque blob in `meta.cf7_additional_settings` to round-trip lossless.

### WPForms

Field structure is a **PHP array serialized** in postmeta `wpforms`. Each field is `{id, type, label, choices?, …}`.

| WPForms type | Canonical type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | `text` | |
| `email` | `email` | |
| `textarea` | `textarea` | |
| `number` | `number` | |
| `number-slider` (Pro) | `number` | Slider UI lost; `warning: informational`. |
| `select` | `select` | `multiple` (Pro) → `cardinality: multi`. |
| `multi-select` (Pro) | `select` | `cardinality: multi`. |
| `checkbox` | `checkbox` | Single checkbox → `cardinality: single`; group → `multi`. |
| `radio` | `radio` | |
| `gdpr-checkbox` | `consent` | |
| `file-upload` (Pro) | `file` | `extensions` → `validation.accepts` (MIME-mapped). `max_size` → `validation.max_size_bytes`. |
| `date-time` | `datetime` (or `date`/`time` based on `format` option) | |
| `phone` | `tel` | |
| `url` | `url` | |
| `name` (composite) | `group` with sub-fields `first` / `middle`? / `last` | `warning: informational` — composite wrapper lost. |
| `address` (composite) | `group` with sub-fields `address1` / `address2` / `city` / `state` / `postal` / `country` | `warning: informational` — composite wrapper lost. |
| `password` | `text` with `format: password` | |
| `rich-text` (Pro) | `textarea` | HTML editor lost; `warning: informational`. |
| `signature` (Pro) | — | `warning: structural`. |
| `rating` (Pro) | — | `warning: structural` — no canonical type. |
| `payment-*` (Pro) | — | `warning: structural` — e-commerce semantics not portable. |
| `divider`, `html`, `pagebreak` | — | `warning: informational` (layout / multi-step). |
| `hidden` | `hidden` | |

**Notifications:** WPForms has an array of notifications natively → maps directly to canonical `notifications[]`. First notification fills `mail_config{}`; remaining go to `notifications[]`.

**Conditional logic:** native array `[{action, logic_type, conditional, conditionals[[...]]}]` → direct mapping on `conditional_rules[]`.

### Gravity Forms

Field structure is a **PHP array serialized** in `wp_gf_form_meta.display_meta`. Fields keyed by integer `id`, mail-tag syntax is `{Label:id}` or `{:id}`.

| Gravity field type | Canonical type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | `text` | |
| `email` | `email` | |
| `phone` | `tel` | |
| `website` | `url` | |
| `number` | `number` | `numberFormat: decimal_dot` → `subtype: decimal`. |
| `textarea` | `textarea` | |
| `select` | `select` | |
| `multiselect` | `select` | `cardinality: multi`. |
| `checkbox` | `checkbox` | `cardinality: multi`. |
| `radio` | `radio` | |
| `date` | `date` | |
| `time` | `time` | |
| `fileupload` | `file` | `allowedExtensions` → `validation.accepts`. `maxFileSize` → `validation.max_size_bytes`. `multipleFiles: true` → `cardinality: multi`. |
| `hidden` | `hidden` | |
| `html`, `section`, `page` | — | `warning: informational` for html/section; `warning: structural` for page (multi-step collapsed). |
| `name` (composite) | `group` with `prefix`/`first`/`middle`/`last`/`suffix` sub-fields | `warning: informational`. |
| `address` (composite) | `group` with street1/street2/city/state/zip/country sub-fields | `warning: informational`. |
| `consent` | `consent` | |
| `password` | `text` with `format: password` | |
| `list` | `group` with `cardinality: multi` | **One of the few clean 1:1 mappings** — Gravity's `list` is a native repeating-row construct. |
| `post_*` (post_title, post_content, post_image, post_tags, post_category, post_custom_field) | — | `warning: structural` — post-creation semantics not portable. |
| `product`, `quantity`, `shipping`, `total`, `option` | — | `warning: structural` — e-commerce semantics not portable. |
| `creditcard` | — | `warning: structural`. Never migrate. |

**Notifications:** Gravity stores N notifications natively → `notifications[]` direct mapping.

**Conditional logic:** native `conditionalLogic: {actionType, logicType, rules:[{fieldId, operator, value}]}` per field → `conditional_rules[]`.

**Mail-tag syntax:** `{Field Label:id}` on Gravity → normalize to `[field-name]` in canonical, using the field's `label` slugified to derive `field-name`.

### Fluent Forms

Field structure is **JSON-serialized** in `wp_fluentform_forms.form_fields`. Fields are objects with `{element, attributes, settings}`.

| Fluent type | Canonical type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `input_text` | `text` | |
| `input_email` | `email` | |
| `input_url` | `url` | |
| `input_password` | `text` with `format: password` | |
| `input_number` | `number` | |
| `input_tel` | `tel` | |
| `textarea` | `textarea` | |
| `select` | `select` | |
| `select_country` | `select` | `choices[]` pre-populated with country list. |
| `multi_select` | `select` | `cardinality: multi`. |
| `input_checkbox` | `checkbox` | |
| `input_radio` | `radio` | |
| `input_date` | `date` (or `datetime` based on format option) | |
| `input_file` | `file` | |
| `input_image` (Pro) | `file` | `validation.accepts: ["image/*"]`. |
| `terms_and_condition`, `gdpr_agreement` | `consent` | |
| `ratings` (Pro) | — | `warning: structural`. |
| `signature` (Pro) | — | `warning: structural`. |
| `repeater_field` (Pro) | `group` with `cardinality: multi` | Pro-only — gate in Phase 1. |
| `address` (composite) | `group` | `warning: informational`. |
| `name` (composite) | `group` | `warning: informational`. |
| `payment_*` (Pro) | — | `warning: structural`. |
| `welcome_screen`, `custom_html`, `section_break`, `step_start`, `step_end` | — | `warning: informational` for html/section; `warning: structural` for steps (multi-step → single-page). |

**Notifications:** Fluent stores notifications via the "Settings → Email Notifications" surface → `notifications[]` array.

**Conditional logic:** `conditional_logics: {status, type, conditions: [{field, operator, value}]}` per field → `conditional_rules[]`.

### Formidable Forms

Field structure is row-based — each field is a row in `wp_frm_fields` linked to a form via `form_id`. Field types are stored as strings.

| Formidable type | Canonical type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | `text` | |
| `email` | `email` | |
| `url` | `url` | |
| `tel` | `tel` | |
| `password` | `text` with `format: password` | |
| `number` | `number` | |
| `phone` | `tel` | |
| `textarea` | `textarea` | |
| `select` | `select` | |
| `checkbox` | `checkbox` | |
| `radio` | `radio` | |
| `date` | `date` | |
| `time` | `time` | |
| `file` | `file` | |
| `image` (Pro) | `file` | `validation.accepts: ["image/*"]`. |
| `divider` (section / page-break) | — | `warning: informational` for section; `warning: structural` for page-break (multi-step → single-page). |
| `html` | — | `warning: informational`. |
| `address` (Pro composite) | `group` | `warning: informational`. |
| `name` (Pro composite) | `group` | `warning: informational`. |
| `lookup` (Pro) | — | `warning: structural` — cross-form lookup not portable. |
| `rich_text` (Pro) | `textarea` | `warning: informational` (editor lost). |
| `signature` (Pro) | — | `warning: structural`. |
| `payment` (Pro) | — | `warning: structural`. |
| `summary` (Pro) | — | `warning: informational` (rendering only). |
| `tags` (Pro) | `checkbox` with `cardinality: multi` (or `select multi`) | `warning: informational`. |

**Notifications:** Formidable calls them "Form Actions". Email actions → `notifications[]`; other action types (post creation, MailChimp, Stripe) → `warning: informational` (third-party / out of scope).

**Conditional logic:** Formidable has structured rules — `conditional_rules[]`.

**Views (Pro):** Formidable Views are display surfaces, not part of the form schema → ignore on migration.

### Ninja Forms

Ninja Forms is **full Novamira-native** in this framework, symmetric with the other five plugins: Novamira Pro drives it through its own `novamira/ninja-forms-*` abilities (the Ninja PHP model layer — `Ninja_Forms()->form()`, the `nf3_*` tables, the `nf_sub` CPT), with no dependency on Ninja's native `ninjaforms/*` abilities.

- `novamira/ninja-forms-check-setup` (Phase 1) — reports version, `min_satisfied`, NF3 storage readiness (`storage_ready`), forms total, available field-type count, capability flags, anti-spam integrations.
- `novamira/ninja-forms-get-form` (Phase 2, raw shape) and `novamira/ninja-forms-get-form-canonical` (Phase 2, canonical) — the canonical reader reads straight from the model layer, maps the Ninja shape onto the 17-type canonical vocabulary, emits `warnings[]`, and rewrites `{field:KEY}` smart tags to `[KEY]`.

For **Phase 5 writes** when Ninja Forms is the **target**, use the Novamira-native write abilities: `novamira/ninja-forms-create-form` (with `fields[]` + `actions[]`), then `ninja-forms-add-field` / `edit-field` for incremental field work, `ninja-forms-create-notification` / `edit-notification` for email notifications, and `ninja-forms-edit-form` for form-level settings.

**Ninja field type → canonical type:**

| Ninja field type | Canonical type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `textbox` | `text` | |
| `textarea` | `textarea` | `input_limit` + `input_limit_type: characters` → `validation.max_length`. |
| `email` | `email` | |
| `number` | `number` (subtype `decimal`) | `num_min` / `num_max` / `num_step` → `validation`. |
| `phone` | `tel` | |
| `date` | `date` | |
| `hidden` | `hidden` | `default_value` rewritten through smart-tag normalisation. |
| `submit` | `submit` | |
| `password`, `passwordconfirm` | `text` (format `password`) | Paired-field semantics lost; `warning: informational` on `passwordconfirm`. |
| `checkbox` | `checkbox` (`cardinality: single`) | Ninja single-checkbox is a yes/no toggle, not a group. |
| `terms` | `consent` | Canonical convention: always `required: true`. |
| `listcheckbox` | `checkbox` (`cardinality: multi`) | Choices from `options[{label,value}]`. |
| `listradio` | `radio` (`cardinality: single`) | |
| `listselect` | `select` (`cardinality: single`) | |
| `listmultiselect` | `select` (`cardinality: multi`) | |
| `listcountry`, `liststate`, `listimage`, `listmodifier` | `select` (`cardinality: single`) | Pre-populated choice lists; UI hint dropped (no warning needed — semantically a select). |
| `address`, `address2`, `city`, `zip`, `firstname`, `lastname` | `text` (flat) | Ninja does not nest composite address / name — fields are flat. `warning: informational` so the target plugin's composite widget (if any) can be reconstructed manually. |
| `repeater` | `group` (`cardinality: multi`) | |

**Ninja types skipped from canonical fields[]** (warning entry only):

| Ninja type | Severity | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `note`, `html`, `hr`, `confirm` | `informational` | Rendering / UI helpers, not data fields. |
| `starrating`, `signature`, `quantity`, `product`, `shipping`, `total`, `creditcard`, `creditcardnumber`, `creditcardcvc`, `creditcardexpiration`, `creditcardfullname`, `creditcardzip` | `structural` | No canonical equivalent — Ninja-specific UI / payment / e-commerce semantics. |
| `hcaptcha`, `recaptcha`, `recaptchav3`, `turnstile`, `spam`, `timedsubmit` | `informational` | Anti-spam — site-global config in Ninja, must be reconfigured on the target. |

**Actions (= notifications):** Ninja stores notifications + redirects + saves + custom integrations under `actions[]`. Only `type: "email"` actions become canonical:
- The first email-action fills `mail_config{}`.
- Remaining email-actions go to `notifications[]` (with `name` derived from each action's `label`).
- All non-email action types (`save`, `successmessage`, `redirect`, `webhook`, third-party CRM / Mailchimp / Stripe integrations) are echoed verbatim to `meta.ninja_forms_non_email_actions` for round-trip + one `warning: informational` per entry.

**Smart-tag normalisation:** Ninja `{field:KEY}` (e.g. `{field:email}`) → canonical `[KEY]` (matches CF7 syntax adopted as canonical). Other Ninja smart tags (`{all_fields_table}`, `{wp:admin_email}`, `{system:date}`, `{user:user_email}`) are preserved verbatim — the target plugin must provide its own equivalents on import.

**Messages mapping:** Ninja keeps user-facing message strings inline in `settings.*` (no dedicated `messages{}` block like CF7). The canonical reader heuristically captures every setting whose key contains `msg` or `message` (e.g. `not_logged_in_msg`, `changeDateErrorMsg`, `validate_required_field`) so module-supplied / user-customised messages survive on round-trip.

**Quirks specific to Ninja Forms:**
- **Native write surface.** Phase 5 (Ninja as target) uses `novamira/ninja-forms-create-form` + `add-field` + `create-notification` (+ `edit-form` for form-level settings). `create-form` auto-appends a submit field, auto-derives + uniquifies field keys (read the returned keys back), and sets the `key` slug column. Notifications are email actions — non-email actions (redirect / save / successmessage / webhook) are written via `novamira/execute-php` (see the `ninja-forms-integration` skill).
- **NF3 storage gate.** `ninja-forms-check-setup` reports `storage_ready`. When it is `false` the NF3 upgrader has not finished — instruct the user to visit the Ninja Forms admin once to complete the install before retrying.
- **Phase 1/2 gate.** Gate the read path on `check-setup.plugin_active` + `min_satisfied` + `storage_ready` — all three true means the model-layer reader and the canonical reader will work. (There is no native-ability count to check; the integration does not use the native `ninjaforms/*` abilities.)
- **Submissions out of scope.** Submitted entries (the `nf_sub` CPT) are NOT part of the form schema migration. Decline politely if the user asks to migrate submissions. Outside the migration flow they can be read or removed via `novamira/ninja-forms-list-submissions` / `get-submission` / `delete-submission`.

## Output schema for each phase

For consistency the agent emits structured output. Suggested shape:

```json
{
  "mode": "plan",
  "source_plugin": "cf7",
  "target_plugin": "wpforms",
  "source_form_id": 142,
  "canonical_schema": { /* the form-model-schema document */ },
  "migration_plan": [
    {
      "step": "create_form",
      "ability": "novamira/wpforms-create-form",
      "payload": { "title": "Contact us", "fields": [/* … */], "notifications": [/* … */] }
    },
    {
      "step": "edit_form_notifications",
      "ability": "novamira/wpforms-edit-form",
      "payload": { "id": "<created form id>", "notifications": [/* extra entries */] }
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    { "path": "fields[5].quiz", "reason": "...", "severity": "structural" }
  ],
  "next_action_required": "user_confirmation_to_execute"
}
```

The `next_action_required` field signals the user what response unblocks the pipeline. Use one of this enum (extend only if a genuinely new case appears):

- `user_confirmation_to_execute` — plan is complete and waiting for go-ahead.
- `user_resolution_for_name_collision` — target already has a form with the same title/slug; user must pick skip / rename / merge.
- `user_decision_on_structural_warnings` — one or more `severity: structural` entries in `warnings[]`; user must accept the loss.
- `user_decision_to_proceed_with_pro_only_types` — payload uses Pro-only field types but the target plugin is Lite.
- `none` — pipeline complete; verification summary present.

**Mode-specific output key inclusion** (do NOT emit absent keys as `null` — leave them out of the JSON entirely):

| Mode | `canonical_schema` | `migration_plan` | `verification_summary` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `audit-only` | ✓ | omit | omit |
| `plan` | ✓ | ✓ | omit |
| `execute` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (emitted after Phase 6 runs) |
| `verify` | ✓ (the target's re-translated canonical) | omit | ✓ |

For `audit-only`, `next_action_required` should be `none` if there are no actionable warnings or unresolved decisions, or one of the `user_decision_*` enum values if structural warnings or Pro-only types require user input before any follow-up `plan` / `execute` would proceed.

## Things to NOT do

- Don't promise lossless migration. Even within the same family (e.g. CF7 → CF7 across two sites) round-trip can drift on reserved-name renames and locale-default message expansion.
- Don't translate builder bindings (Elementor form widget references, Bricks contact-form binding) — they reference the source form's numeric ID and will break. Flag for re-binding instead.
- Don't combine schema migration and submission migration in one pass.
- Don't run the pipeline against a production site without `audit-only` first. If the user has only one environment, encourage them to dry-run on a clone.
- Don't market or describe this as "one-click universal import/export". Use "AI-assisted form schema migration" — it sets the right expectation.

## Things that are safe and encouraged

- Run `audit-only` first on every new migration request. Cheap, informative, surfaces all warnings before any commitment.
- Snapshot the canonical schema at the start of execute mode (save to a file the user can re-open) — it's the only authoritative record of what was migrated.
- For multi-form sites, loop the pipeline per form rather than batching — each gets its own audit/plan/confirm cycle, and a failure on one form doesn't taint the others.
- Recommend the source form stay live for a transition window — the user can validate the target side against the source before deleting anything.
- After migration, run a manual front-end submission on the target form to confirm the mail config actually delivers — the schema can be 100% correct and a typo in `mail_config.recipient` still breaks the form.
